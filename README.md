# 🌀 **Centered Div Therapy**

Do you wake up at 2 a.m. haunted by the ghosts of divs past, screaming, *“Why won’t you center?”* Do you secretly enjoy the thrill of `margin: auto` roulette? Well, fear no more—our app is here to help you achieve **div-centering nirvana** across all browsers.

Also, it’s silly. Because why shouldn’t centering a div be fun?


## 🚀 **What Does This App Even Do?**

Great question! Here's what we're working with:

1. **Interactive Div-Centering Tool**  
   Forget the days of manually tweaking CSS for hours. Now you can engage in a completely unnecessary—but highly satisfying—process of centering a div with ease.

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**  
   Tired of Chrome making you look good while Firefox betrays you? We’ve got you. This app works seamlessly across browsers, so no one (read: your QA team) can ruin your centering dreams.

3. **Playfully Purposeful Design**  
   Why is this app even a thing? We don’t know. But it’s silly, it’s fun, and honestly, it’s probably going to teach someone, somewhere, how to center a div. *We’re doing the Lord’s work here.*


## 🛠 **How to Get Started**

1. Clone the repo. (You’re a dev. You know the drill.)

   cd div-centering-saga
2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the app.
